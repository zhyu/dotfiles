# Shell Context Documentation
# =================================================
#
# SHELL_CONTEXT controls plugin loading and shell behavior:
#
# Contexts:
# - "interactive": Full-featured interactive shell (default)
# - "vscode": VS Code/Cursor integrated terminal (core + dev tools)
# - "script": Script execution (minimal plugins for performance)
#
# Detection Logic:
# - VS Code: VSCODE_INJECTION, TERM_PROGRAM=vscode/cursor, VSCODE_PID, etc.
# - Scripts: ZSH_SCRIPT, ZSH_EXECUTION_STRING, non-tty environments
# - Interactive: Default fallback for terminal sessions
#
# Manual Override: export SHELL_CONTEXT="context_name"
# =================================================

# Note: `tmux attach` should not be wrapped with `exec`, otherwise the connection will
# be closed when connecting to a server via ssh and there are no tmux sessions to attach to.
